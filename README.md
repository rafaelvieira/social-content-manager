# social-content-manager
A social content manager

Objective: App for simple organization and content sharing in a family or friends group. 
Problem: social networks and messaging apps do not provide ways to properly organize content that people need to easily remember and search. We need a reliable source that could be queried by our groups without any hassle.
They surely could use Google Drive or any other virtual drive tool to do it. These tools, however, seem to be originally as a personal driver that can be shared, and not as a shared place at first. It would be interesting to have some tool that is group-oriented.
Below are the features:

- create groups
- define admins
- invite members
- create/update/list contents, in which someone could, for instance, share links. 
- organize content with tagging or hierarchy
- full-text or tag content search
- hierarchical content navigation
- group name is the subdomain to the app

Future: later, it would be interesting to quickly share apps and other stuff that could be integrated into this app.
